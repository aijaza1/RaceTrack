# RaceTrack

This project is a dynamic GUI application that simulates a race between three cars on separate tracks. The application uses multithreading to ensure smooth animations and concurrent movements of the cars. Users can interact with the GUI, controlling the race with options to start, pause, and reset the race. As the cars progress randomly, the first car to cross the finish line triggers a winner screen, creating a seamless user experience. The project offers an engaging racing adventure that can be restarted at any time.
